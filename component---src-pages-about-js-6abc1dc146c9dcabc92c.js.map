The ‘90s took him from Jules Shear (“All\n        Through the Night”) to Germany, where he played with Nena (“99 Red\n        Balloons”).\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Some of the others who have sought him out on stage or in the studio are\n        Denis Leary, Idina Menzel, Louise Goffin, Michael Des Barres, Robert\n        Gordon, Pal Shazar, Paul Hipp, Danielle Evin, Jeff Slate, Ricky Byrd,\n        Diane Gentile, Jimmy Vivino, Andy York, Johnny Pisano and Rich Pagano\n        among many others. He’s also shared stages with some of the greats,\n        including Brian May, Johnny Depp, Bruce Springsteen and yes, even Paul\n        McCartney. He actually stepped into the ring to accompany the Raging\n        Bull, Jake LaMotta—don’t ask!\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Television appearances include late nights like David Letterman and the\n        early shows too, CBS This Morning and Good Day New York; and in the UK,\n        The Andrew Marr Show and in France, Le Grand Journal.\n        <br />\n        <br />A soulful, fiery and tasteful player known for his lyrical solos,\n        Mark has also provided guitar instruction and mentoring to well over one\n        hundred players. He coached Billy Crudup for his role in the hit movie\n        Almost Famous and was sought out by Lou Reed (yes that Lou Reed) to\n        learn the technique of Travis Picking. Many of his students have gone on\n        to become successful singer-songwriters and teachers themselves. Mark\n        will often customize lessons to accompany students’ goals and doesn’t\n        follow a preset curriculum. He teaches rhythm/lead for both acoustic and\n        electric and excels in music theory which one can apply to any\n        instrument.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This feature article about Mark in Vintage Guitar Magazine is entitled\n        “New York State of Mind.”{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.vintageguitar.com/29106/mark-bosch/\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          https://www.vintageguitar.com/29106/mark-bosch/\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        With Facetime, Zoom and Skype, his reach to teach is now worldwide…\n        let’s start playing!\n        {/* <h3> MARK BOSCH</h3> dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
